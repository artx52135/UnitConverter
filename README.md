# UnitConverter
UnitConverter serves a quite simple purpose: transferring units of volume and weight (e.g. in recipes) from the US system to metric and back. 
These functions of conversion are produced by two commands named massReplace(Imperial/Metric)Units, which are treating each instance of a unit separately according to conversion rules.
